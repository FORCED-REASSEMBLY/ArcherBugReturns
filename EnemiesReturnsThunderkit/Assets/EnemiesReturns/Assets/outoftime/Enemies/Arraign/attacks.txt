[2:13]Moffein:
Basic Primary Attack: 3-step Melee Combo
First 2 steps are a sword slash + lunge
Last step is an overhead slam, with endlag to punish him
In later phases, he could be allowed to use this midair with gravity disabled to chase down flyers.

Basic Ranged Attack: Homing Energy Orbs
Shoots a barrage of 5 homing energy orbs (like Lunar Wisps). Contextually used if no one is in melee range and skill is off-cooldown.

Mobility: Sky Leap + Thunder Slam
Leap into the air and disappear like mithrix.
Show a tracking AoE indicator on the ground below a player, follows the player for a bit before stopping.
Slam down, dealing AoE damage in the indicator, and spawning lightning strikes around him.

Sword Dash + Laser
Prepare a sword dash, then dash forwards (this can be aimed vertically to hit jumping targets)
After a delay, a giant high damage laser is spawned along the dash path for X seconds.
In later phases, he can use this multiple times in a row.

Sword Toss
Only used against airborne enemies. Contextual skill replacement based on AI target or missed attacks?
Toss sword towards a player, sword will stop at the player's location and spin for a bit, repeatedly dealing damage.
After a few seconds, teleport to the sword, then contextually do a melee attack or a projectile attack depending on whether anyone is in range.

Sky Lasers
Teamwide superattack.
Spawn a bunch of giant (8m wide? 12m wide?) lasers on all players, with a minimum of 3 spawned in solo.
Lasers are oriented vertically, like a giant pillar.
Lasers follow player movement, moving quickly enough that you have to full-commit to dodging to avoid it.
While the lasers are active, Arraign can use other attacks.
