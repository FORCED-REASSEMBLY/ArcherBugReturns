# EnemiesReturns
A mod that adds enemies that somehow got lost between Risk of Rain 1 and Risk of Rain 2.

Currently adds:
* Spitter
	* Golem-sized enemy that will stay mid-range, barraging survivors with devastating projectiles that split on impact, leaving deadly toxic goo on the ground. It only uses melee as last resort, never attempting to fight in melee range unless the target comes to it.
	* Can spawn on Wetland Aspect, Verdant Falls, Sulfur Pools and Abyssal Depths. If installed it can also spawn on Fogbound Lagoon.

Mod is in active development, please address all bugs and suggestions to @viliger in modding discord or create an issue on github page.
