<summary>0.1.8 </summary>

* Added new Champion-tier (or boss) monster: Colossus.
* Spitter:
	* Split projectiles no longer collide with bodies.
		* _It is done to remove "shotgun effect" where in some situations, depending on target's and Spitter's elevation all 4 projectiles will hit the same target, resulting in massive, unintended damage._
* Added pt-BR translation by [Kauzok](https://github.com/Kauzok)

* Spitter:
	* Fixed log book display and text.
	* Fixed log book text showing up in chat on Spitter's monster log pickup.
	* Fixed Spitter not being stunnable, frozable, etc.
	* Adjusted sounds' volume and attenuation to roughly match vanilla.

	* Slight adjustments to elite colors so hopefully Overloading and Glacial are easier to differenciate.
