<summary>0.1.9 </summary>

* Fixed an issue where loading the game with mod's unsupported language would hang the game at 100%.
* Spitter:
	* A big thanks to [rob](https://thunderstore.io/package/rob_gaming/) for a new set of animations!
	* Spitter now slows down on charging spit to 70% of movement speed and comes to a complete stop on spit release.
	* Charged Spit now has a sound cue on charging the attack.
	* Added 2 second cooldown on Bite.
		* _He was quite relentless in melee range when the intention was that it would be somewhat of a last resort for him. This should calm him down._
* Colossus:
	* Laser Barrage explosion radius increased from 5 to 10.
		* _You could just stand in front of him and not get hit, ever. It was never my intention to make this attack hard to dodge, but it should serve it intended purpose - create a hell zone in front of him that you need to get away from ASAP. Hopefully this will make it closer to that intent._
	* Lowered director cost to 1200.
	* Added Void Fields and Abyssal Depths as possible spawn stage.
		* _I've got a lot of reports that people just don't see him in runs. Lowering director cost and adding him to the only stage 4 he can kinda fit in (he can't go into the cave) should hopefully make him less rare. Void Fields should probably be behind config tho._
	* Fixed head disappearing under certain angles.
	* Added Sky Meadows variant. 
	* Added Castle variant (don't get your hopes up).
	* Fixed eye glow and light not going out on death. 
	* Fixed idle animation blending with death animation.
	* Fixed footstep effects not playing. 
	* Now you should really be careful when Colossus steps and falls to the ground.
	* hehe boner

<summary>0.1.8 </summary>

* Added new Champion-tier (or boss) monster: Colossus.
* Spitter:
	* Split projectiles no longer collide with bodies.
		* _It is done to remove "shotgun effect" where in some situations, depending on target's and Spitter's elevation all 4 projectiles will hit the same target, resulting in massive, unintended damage._
* Added pt-BR translation by [Kauzok](https://github.com/Kauzok)

<summary>0.0.12 </summary>

* Spitter:
	* Fixed log book display and text.
	* Fixed log book text showing up in chat on Spitter's monster log pickup.
	* Fixed Spitter not being stunnable, frozable, etc.
	* Adjusted sounds' volume and attenuation to roughly match vanilla.
	* Made projectile and DoT zone decal more orange-ish.
	* Slight adjustments to elite colors so hopefully Overloading and Glacial are easier to differenciate.
	* Added monster to Void Cells, Abyssal Depths (Simulacrum) and Bulwark's Ambry.
